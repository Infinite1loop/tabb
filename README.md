# tabb

#### summary

The internal search in the browser can only search based on url/title, while tabb can search based on the content of the page, supporting searching for the content of tab/bookmark/history.

The effect is as follows:

![tabb1](./asset/tabb1.png)

![tabb2](./asset/tabb2.png)

#### Installation/Usage

You need to enable developer mode and then load dist/chrome.

After installation, simply click on the icon or use Cmd+K (mac), Ctrl+K (other) to use it.

Tabb: A browser extension tool that allows deep searching of Tabs/Bookmarks/History.

You can search for content on a page. I saw a tool before that could search for Tabs, often I would have browsed a page earlier but couldn't find it again. The internal tools of the browser can only search url/title; so I made a small tool that can index url/title/content.

Feel free to try it out!
